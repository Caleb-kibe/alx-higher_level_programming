# Project README: Python - Network #0

## Project Overview

This project, titled "Python - Network #0" (Project 0x10), is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of networking concepts and HTTP protocol fundamentals using Python. By completing this project, participants will gain practical knowledge and theoretical insights into various aspects of web communication, including URLs, HTTP requests and responses, HTTP headers, request methods, response status codes, cookies, and more.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following concepts related to general and application-level understanding of networking and HTTP:

### General

- URL: Understand the concept of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and its role in specifying the location of resources on the web.
  
- HTTP: Grasp the fundamentals of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its significance in facilitating communication between clients and servers.

- Reading a URL: Ability to interpret and break down a URL into its constituent components, including the scheme, domain name, sub-domain, port number, and query string.

- Scheme for a HTTP URL: Understand the structure of a HTTP URL and the significance of its scheme (e.g., "http" or "https").

- Domain Name: Define a domain name and understand how it is used to identify specific web servers.

- Sub-domain: Understand the concept of a sub-domain and how it is employed to categorize websites within a domain.

- Port Number in a URL: Learn how port numbers are specified in a URL to indicate the communication endpoint on the server.

- Query String: Define a query string and understand its purpose in passing data to a web server as part of a URL.

- HTTP Request: Understand the structure and purpose of an HTTP request, including headers and the message body.

- HTTP Response: Grasp the structure and contents of an HTTP response, including status codes, headers, and the response body.

- HTTP Headers: Understand the role of HTTP headers in providing additional information about the request or response.

- HTTP Message Body: Define the HTTP message body and its significance in transmitting data between clients and servers.

- HTTP Request Method: Learn about HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their purposes.

- HTTP Response Status Code: Understand HTTP response status codes and their meanings in indicating the success or failure of a request.

- HTTP Cookie: Define what an HTTP cookie is and its role in maintaining stateful sessions between a client and server.

- Making a Request with cURL: Acquire the skills to use cURL, a command-line tool, to make HTTP requests and inspect responses.

### Application Level

- Typing google.com in a Browser: Explain the process that occurs when you type "google.com" in a web browser, including DNS resolution, establishing a TCP connection, sending an HTTP request, receiving an HTTP response, and rendering the web page.
